NAME
     SEAWAT-2000 - Three-dimensional variable-density ground-water flow model

ABSTRACT
SEAWAT-2000 is the latest release of the SEAWAT computer program for simulation
of three-dimensional, variable-density, transient ground-water flow in porous 
media. SEAWAT-2000 was designed by combining a modified version of MODFLOW-2000 
and MT3DMS into a single computer program. The code was developed using the 
MODFLOW-2000 concept of a process, which is defined as “part of the code that 
solves a fundamental equation by a specified numerical method.” SEAWAT-2000 contains
all of the processes distributed with MODFLOW-2000 and also includes the Variable-
Density Flow Process (as an alternative to the constant-density Ground-Water Flow 
Process) and the Integrated MT3DMS Transport Process. Processes may be active or 
inactive, depending on simulation objectives; however, not all processes are 
compatible. For example, the Sensitivity and Parameter Estimation Processes are 
not compatible with the Variable-Density Flow and Integrated MT3DMS Transport 
Processes. The SEAWAT-2000 computer code was tested with the common variable-
density benchmark problems and also with problems representing evaporation from 
a salt lake and rotation of immiscible fluids.

METHOD
The variable-density ground-water flow equation is solved using a finite-
difference approximation similar to the one solved by MODFLOW-2000.  The solute-
transport equation is solved using one of the approaches available with MT3DMS.

HISTORY

SEAWAT-2000 Version 3.12.00 2006/03/14 - This version of SEAWAT was updated with
MT3DMS Version 5.10, which includes a new zero-order growth/decay option within
the reactions package.  This option may be useful for simulating groundwater age 
as a separate species.

SEAWAT-2000 Version 3.11.02 2005/09/23 - This version of SEAWAT contains a fix 
for a minor bug that may have caused some transport timesteps to be too short.  
Thanks to Matthijs Bonte for helping to identify this problem.

SEAWAT-2000 Version 3.11.01 2005/07/25 - This version of SEAWAT contains a bug
fix for head-dependent flux calculations for some boundary types.  Thanks to
Alyssa Dausman for helping to identify this bug.

SEAWAT-2000 Version 3.11.00 2005/04/29 - Added MODFLOW-2000 Version 1.15.00 and
MT3DMS Version 5.00.  Also added compatability between MNW wells and the VDF
Process for freshwater parts of a model domain.

SEAWAT-2000 Version 3.10.01 2004/03/30 - This version of SEAWAT contains a couple
of minor bug fixes from the previous version.

SEAWAT-2000 Version 3.10 2004/02/13 - This version of SEAWAT contains substantial
improvements over previous releases.  The program is now based on MODFLOW-2000
(Version 1.12.01) and MT3DMS (Version 4.500), and uses the concept of a process.
Details of SEAWAT-2000 are described in U.S. Geological Survey Open-File Report
03-426.

SEAWAT Version 2.12 2002/09/13 - Fixed problem with calculation of EVT fluid
density.  Thanks to Adam Taylor and Barclay Shoemaker.  Also fixed bug in
calculation of default riverbed thickness.  Thanks to Lou Motz and Nebiyu
Tiruneh from the University of Florida for locating this problem.

SEAWAT Version 2.11 2002/08/09 - Fixed bug that caused program to bomb 
for certain problems involving wetting and drying.  Thanks to Trayle Kulshan and
Steve Gorelick from Stanford University for help in locating this problem.

SEAWAT Version 2.10 2002/02/07 - Code consists of MODFLOW-88 and MT3DMS Version 
3.50.A.  Upgraded the CFACE subroutine with the improved CFACE subroutine from 
MT3DMS Version 4.00.  Reformulated flow equation to conserve fluid mass.  
Redesigned boundary conditions to represent variable-density flow.  Added an 
iterative method for coupling flow and transport.  Program redesigned as double 
precision.

SEAWAT Version 1.1 1998/05/01 - Initially released by Weixing Guo (Missimer 
International, Inc.) and Gordon D. Bennett (S.S. Papadopulos & Associates, Inc.)

DATA REQUIREMENTS
In order to use SEAWAT, initial conditions, hydraulic properties, and stresses 
must be specified for every model cell in the finite-difference grid.

OUTPUT OPTIONS
Primary output is head and concentration, which can be written to the listing 
file or to separate binary files.  Other output includes the complete listing of 
all input data, drawdown, flow budget, and transport budget data.  Flow budget 
data are printed as a summary in the listing file, and detailed budget data for 
all model cells can be written into a separate file.  All binary output is 
written to files that are opened with the FORM='BINARY' option.  This means that 
some pre- and post-processors may not be able to read the output unless the open 
statements are modified, the program is recompiled, and the model is rerun.

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
SEAWAT is written in Fortran 77 with the following extensions:  use of variable 
names longer than 6 characters, Fortran 90 statements for dynamic memory 
allocation, a call to SUBROUTINE GETARG to retrieve command-line arguments, and
two calls to DATE_AND_TIME, which is a Fortran 90 intrinsic subroutine. Generally, 
the program is easily installed on most computer systems.  The code has been used on 
DOS-based 386 or greater computers having a math coprocessor and 4 mb of memory.  Parts
of the GMG solver are written in the C programming language.

PROCESSES
GLO1 -- Global Process
GWF1 -- Ground-Water Flow Process
VDF1 -- Variable-Density Flow Process
OBS1 -- Observation Process
SEN1 -- Sensitivity Process
PES1 -- Parameter-Estimation Process
IMT1 -- Integrated MT3DMS Process

Process compatibility issues are described in the user's manual.  In general, the VDF 
and IMT Processes are not compatible with SEN and PES, and are only slightly 
compatible with OBS.  VDF is an alternative to GWF, and thus the two cannot be used
concurrently in a simulation. 

PACKAGES COMPATIBLE WITH THE VARIABLE-DENSITY FLOW (VDF) PROCESS
BAS6 -- Basic 
BCF6 -- Block-Centered Flow 
LPF -- Layer Property Flow 
HUF2 -- Hydrogeologic Unit Flow. Note that VDF is not yet compatible with 
        the Layer Variable-Direction Horizontal Anisotropy (LVDA) capability.
        The LVDA capability should not be used with the VDF process.  The VDF
        process is compatible with the three features described in Open-File
        Report 03-347.

Other packages (distributed with MODFLOW-2000) are included in SEAWAT-2000, however,
these additional packages may not be compatible with the VDF Process.
