o Version 3.10 2/13/2003:

This is the first public release of the SEAWAT-2000 program, which is 
documented in OFR 03-426.

Since OFR 03-426 was printed and distributed, the FHB and HUF2 packages
have been incorporated into SEAWAT-2000.  There are no special instructions
for using the FHB package.  Presently, the Layer Variable-Direction Horizontal 
Anisotropy (LVDA) capability is not compatible with the VDF process.  The 
version of MODFLOW-2000 included in this release is Version 1.12.01.  The 
version of MT3DMS included in this release is Version 4.50.

With this release, there is one known bug: the Variable-Density Flow (VDF)
Process may not produce accurate results if quasi-three-dimensional layers
are included in the simulation.  Quasi-three-dimensional layers should not
be used with the VDF Process.
