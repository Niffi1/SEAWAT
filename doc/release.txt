o Version 4.00.03 9/21/2009:

Corrected several programming errors and implemented an indexing option that
may improve computational efficiency for variable-density solute transport 
models with numerous rivers, wells, and general-head boundaries.  Program 
updated with MODFLOW Version 1.18.01.

o Version 4.00.02 9/19/2008:

Corrected two programming errors, both related to memory conflicts.  The MNW
Package may not have worked correctly in previous versions of SEAWAT Version
4.  Also, the OBS Process may have had a memory conflict with the MT3DMS
Process.

o Version 4.00.01 4/29/2008:

Corrected a programming error caused by implementation of the flow field 
update control option.  The error resulted in dcdt terms that were too
large.  

o Version 4.00.00 3/28/2008:

This is the first public release of the SEAWAT Version 4 program, which is 
documented in Langevin et al. (2007).  In addition to the new features, this 
release contains fixes for several bugs found in earlier SEAWAT Versions.
