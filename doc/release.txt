o Version 3.10.01 3/30/2003:

Following the convention for MODFLOW-2000 releases, this release is
designated as 3.10.01.  The ".01" indicates that this release contains
only bug fixes, rather than new packages or features.

This version contains bug fixes for three coding errors: (1) In the previous 
version, the value for HDRY was not always written to the output head file if 
a cell went dry during the simulation.  (2) A runtime error was encountered
in certain instances when the IMT Process was used with the GWF Process 
(instead of the VDF Process).  (3)  If MODFLOW timesteps were shorter
than the calculated transport timestep, the density array was not updated
properly.  To correct these errors, changes were made to swt2k.f and vdf1.f.


o Version 3.10 2/13/2003:

This is the first public release of the SEAWAT-2000 program, which is 
documented in OFR 03-426.

Since OFR 03-426 was printed and distributed, the FHB and HUF2 packages
have been incorporated into SEAWAT-2000.  There are no special instructions
for using the FHB package.  Presently, the Layer Variable-Direction Horizontal 
Anisotropy (LVDA) capability is not compatible with the VDF process.  The 
version of MODFLOW-2000 included in this release is Version 1.12.01.  The 
version of MT3DMS included in this release is Version 4.50.

With this release, there is one known bug: the Variable-Density Flow (VDF)
Process may not produce accurate results if quasi-three-dimensional layers
are included in the simulation.  Quasi-three-dimensional layers should not
be used with the VDF Process.
